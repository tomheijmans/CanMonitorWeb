# CanMonitorWeb

This project is an alternative to the Rust-lang CLI interface in the [CanMonitor project](https://github.com/tomheijmans/CanMonitor). It is build using Angular and uses the [web serial api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Serial). By using this stack it can be used with just a browser (and ofcourse an arduino for input). Serial input for this project is CAN-data which is send using an arduino. Source and more info can be found at my [CanMonitor repository](https://github.com/tomheijmans/CanMonitor#can_monitor_arduino).
